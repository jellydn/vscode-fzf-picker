## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the git preview system that explains how git status integration works, including preview commands, file handling, and the smart preview system for different file states (tracked, untracked, modified).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Documentation file created at docs/git-preview-system.md
- [x] System architecture clearly explained
- [x] Preview command logic documented
- [x] File handling for different git states covered
- [x] Examples and configuration options included

## Implementation Plan

1. Research git preview system implementation in codebase\n2. Analyze git status integration and preview commands\n3. Document smart preview system for different file states\n4. Create comprehensive documentation with examples\n5. Review and finalize documentation structure

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive documentation for the git preview system architecture. The documentation covers all aspects of the system including smart preview commands, file state detection, configuration options, and troubleshooting. The system intelligently handles different file states (tracked vs untracked) and provides appropriate previews with syntax highlighting where available.
